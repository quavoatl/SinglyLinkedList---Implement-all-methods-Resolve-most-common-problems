**Implemented most of the methods of a Singly Linked List (push, insertAfterGivenNode, append, deleteNode, deleteNodeAtGivenPosition). Also wrote different methods for problems like(swapNodes, reverseList, mergeSortList, binarySearch, mergeTwoSortedLists, removeDuplicates, detectAndRemoveLoop, rotateList)**
